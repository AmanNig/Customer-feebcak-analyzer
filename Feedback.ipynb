              "0      I had three credit cards with Barclays. An UBER card, an XXXX XXXX card, and an XXXX  card. The UBER card is the only one I had been using and it was the main credit card I used on a daily basis. In late XX/XX/XXXX, I got a letter from Barclays saying they had closed my XXXX XXXX card due to inactivity. So I went online to see what was going on and found out they had already also closed my XXXX card. Now this was a big deal to me because the XXXX card had rewards on it worth over {$1000.00}. So I called Barclays customer support the next day and ended up having to talk to a manager. The only thing the manager told me was Barclays could close my credit card without notice for any reason. And as much as I tried to get her to comment on the rewards I had, she would not comment on them. Then I notice in Barclays terms and conditions for the XXXX  card that they had a mailing address set up for customers who wanted to make a formal complaint. So I wrote a letter and mailed it via USPS certified mail. Ive been waiting for over a month and have not received a response. \\n\\nThe letter I sent Barclays is attached. It includes more detail such as the fact that I was checking the Barclays web site every month using Barclays mobile app for the XXXX. And even after Barclays closes your credit card, there is no notice in the app that the card has been closed. The card account just shows up completely like a normal account. So there was no way for me to realize the card had been closed. Ive got screen shots of Barclays XXXX app included in the letter that shows this. And there is an XXXX  card account statement included with the letter showing the amount of rewards I had in that account. \\n\\nThe USPS tracking number for the letter I sent Barclays is XXXX. If you check the USPS web site you can see I mailed it XX/XX/2019 and Barclays received it XX/XX/2019.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
              "1      I purchased furniture from Macy 's. The product arrived so damaged that I could not return in the packaging that was provided. I offered them the opportunity to refund half of the purchase and I would keep the furniture and they would not have to pick it up. \\n\\nSince COVID19, they closed all customer service including their credit card servicing department. I filed a dispute and have heard nothing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
              "2      I deposited a {$800.00} check to Chase from my XXXX  husbands XXXX checking account on XX/XX/20. It cleared on XX/XX/20. Chase will not clear the check for 15 days. \\n\\nChase has consistently been putting extremely long holds on my XXXX  spouses checks to me. They have tied up {$1500.00} for 15 days just this week alone. Now we are late with rent. \\n\\nI called Chase and held for 2 hours and spoke to XXXX at XXXX. I also sent images of the cleared deposits to chase via secure messaging. \\n\\nXXXX refused to call XXXX with me in a conference call with XXXX to confirm the check cleared because she does not know how to do her job and interact with a XXXX  XXXX person through an XXXX. She said we could go out in the middle of a pandemic to a branch or just wait. She refused to call XXXX with all parties sitting right there trying to explain to her how to confirm a check cleared. \\n\\nOur lease is up for renewal and we are already late with our rent. We dont need XXXX   like XXXX who dont know how to do their job absolutely destroying our finances. \\n\\nI want the hold on the cleared check released and a courtesy of {$100.00} for the rent late fees they are causing. \\n\\nThis was XXXX XXXX Whatsoever you do to the least of these you do to me.

              "45957  The debt collector is attempting to collect a debt for a truck that is not my account. Her name is XXXX XXXX and her phone is XXXX XXXX. When I call her back to tell her that this is not my account she asks for the number that SHE is calling. I do not know what number she is calling so I give her the main number to my place of work so she can remove it. That number does not come up in her system so there is nothing she can do. I keep getting calls from her and it is embarrassing and harassing at my professional medical office. This is not my debt and they have the wrong person but she has no way to remove me unless I can tell HER THE CORRECT NUMBER THAT SHE IS CALLING. This seems wrong to me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
              "45958  Monday, XX/XX/2020 at approximately XXXX XXXX My husband and I went to the ATM at US Bank, XXXX, MO XXXX, attempted to deposit {$900.00} ( 4 - {$50.00}, 5 - {$20.00} and 6- {$100.00} ), the machine started having problems, it spit out {$700.00} of the money and continually tried to either discharge the other {$200.00} or keep it, it eventually stopped and closed up without dispensing the rest of our money. We immediately went into the branch, XXXX helped us, she got her keys and indicated that she was the one who handles the ATM transactions, 2 employees in the branch stated oh no, money is stuck in the ATM again, so this is obviously an ongoing problem. XXXX came back to the counter several minutes later and stated that she could not see anything on this side of the ATM, however she would be the one counting it and that a repair would be done tonight. I asked if I could call in the morning and she stated yes, I said I would call at XXXX XXXX and she said to give her more time than that. This has been the 2nd time that this has happened to us at the same branch, the other time was approximately 6 months ago. \\nXXXX called us on the way home and told me to report the dispute to the main US Bank number, I did and received a Dispute # XXXX as confirmation. \\nTuesday, XX/XX/2020 XXXX XXXX I called and spoke with XXXX, who indicated that the ATM had not been counted, there was an emergency, no one had been there to look at this machine, she did not know when this would happen, stated that she didnt have anything to do with the process and that it would have to be handled through the main office. I was dumbfounded and asked why she had said to call after she had a chance to count the ATM money, she got rude at this point and again stated there was an emergency and there was only 2 people working and did not know when she would get to it. \\nMain Number for US Bank XXXX Explained that it could take up to 10 business days to receive the credit and up to 45 for the completion of the dispute. \\nThe more I thought about this, the more upset I became, {$200.00} may not seem like a lot to the Tellers that work at the bank, however to most people it is a lot. The fact that she outright lied and that this is a continual problem with the fact that she treated me disrespectful and rudely trying to make me think I had misunderstood her has prompted me to take this as high as I need to for satisfaction. We have had an account with US Bank for over 5 years, with 0 overdrafts and it does not matter if I keep {$1.00} or {>= $1,000,000} in the account, the fact I choose to put my money in US Bank and then to be treated that way, is outrageous. \\nXXXX Friendly and helpful, attempted to transfer call to Supevisor XXXX XXXX, it did ring one time and then I was disconnected XXXX Attempted to help as well and provided the phone numbers for a complaint higher up I have made a formal complaint with the Corporate Office ( XXXX ) and am waiting for the District Manager to call me for a resolution. I have also filed a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and will continually research other options for a timely resolution to this matter. I can be reached at XXXX to further discuss this matter. \\nI posted this response to XXXX  on US Banks page and sent a XXXX  message, they responded that someone would call within one business day. \\nXXXX/Branch Mgr./XXXX  called and apologized, said there was miscommunication between XXXX and us and asked if there was anything else she could do. \\nFiled report with Federal Trade Commission and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. \\nThe District Manager did not call as promised.   \n",
              "45959  I called Credit Control Corp and explained that this account was opened fraudulently by my estranged spouse. This account was opened 2 days after I left for XXXX basic training. I could not have opened this account for myself. The address in which the internet and cable company was listed as my estranged spouses address. They told me on XX/XX/2019 that they were going to take care of this account. It still remains on my credit file. I attempted to call them on XX/XX/2019 and began speaking to someone and then was hung up on.

              "45961  I filed a dispute to XXXX  regarding ambulatory service charges of {$1400.00} through XXXX XXXX. My insurance info was given many times so i am not sure why this account is in collections. When i filed a dispute it took very long for them to give an answer and i had to dig for the answer ( re file a dispute gave me my answer that XXXX  did nothing ). XXXX  never reached out to me or emailed me to tell me they had an answer. This info is incorrect and should not be in collections. This battered my credit score.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

              "      <td>I had three credit cards with Barclays. An UBER card, an XXXX XXXX card, and an XXXX  card. The UBER card is the only one I had been using and it was the main credit card I used on a daily basis. In late XX/XX/XXXX, I got a letter from Barclays saying they had closed my XXXX XXXX card due to inactivity. So I went online to see what was going on and found out they had already also closed my XXXX card. Now this was a big deal to me because the XXXX card had rewards on it worth over {$1000.00}. So I called Barclays customer support the next day and ended up having to talk to a manager. The only thing the manager told me was Barclays could close my credit card without notice for any reason. And as much as I tried to get her to comment on the rewards I had, she would not comment on them. Then I notice in Barclays terms and conditions for the XXXX  card that they had a mailing address set up for customers who wanted to make a formal complaint. So I wrote a letter and mailed it via USPS certified mail. Ive been waiting for over a month and have not received a response. \\n\\nThe letter I sent Barclays is attached. It includes more detail such as the fact that I was checking the Barclays web site every month using Barclays mobile app for the XXXX. And even after Barclays closes your credit card, there is no notice in the app that the card has been closed. The card account just shows up completely like a normal account. So there was no way for me to realize the card had been closed. Ive got screen shots of Barclays XXXX app included in the letter that shows this. And there is an XXXX  card account statement included with the letter showing the amount of rewards I had in that account. \\n\\nThe USPS tracking number for the letter I sent Barclays is XXXX. If you check the USPS web site you can see I mailed it XX/XX/2019 and Barclays received it XX/XX/2019.</td>\n",

We immediately went into the branch, XXXX helped us, she got her keys and indicated that she was the one who handles the ATM transactions, 2 employees in the branch stated oh no, money is stuck in the ATM again, so this is obviously an ongoing problem. XXXX came back to the counter several minutes later and stated that she could not see anything on this side of the ATM, however she would be the one counting it and that a repair would be done tonight. I asked if I could call in the morning and she stated yes, I said I would call at XXXX XXXX and she said to give her more time than that. This has been the 2nd time that this has happened to us at the same branch, the other time was approximately 6 months ago. \\nXXXX called us on the way home and told me to report the dispute to the main US Bank number, I did and received a Dispute # XXXX as confirmation. \\nTuesday, XX/XX/2020 XXXX XXXX I called and spoke with XXXX, who indicated that the ATM had not been counted, there was an emergency, no one had been there to look at this machine, she did not know when this would happen, stated that she didnt have anything to do with the process and that it would have to be handled through the main office. I was dumbfounded and asked why she had said to call after she had a chance to count the ATM money, she got rude at this point and again stated there was an emergency and there was only 2 people working and did not know when she would get to it. \\nMain Number for US Bank XXXX Explained that it could take up to 10 business days to receive the credit and up to 45 for the completion of the dispute. \\nThe more I thought about this, the more upset I became, {$200.00} may not seem like a lot to the Tellers that work at the bank, however to most people it is a lot. The fact that she outright lied and that this is a continual problem with the fact that she treated me disrespectful and rudely trying to make me think I had misunderstood her has prompted me to take this as high as I need to for satisfaction. We have had an account with US Bank for over 5 years, with 0 overdrafts and it does not matter if I keep {$1.00} or {&gt;= $1,000,000} in the account, the fact I choose to put my money in US Bank and then to be treated that way, is outrageous. \\nXXXX Friendly and helpful, attempted to transfer call to Supevisor XXXX XXXX, it did ring one time and then I was disconnected XXXX Attempted to help as well and provided the phone numbers for a complaint higher up I have made a formal complaint with the Corporate Office ( XXXX ) and am waiting for the District Manager to call me for a resolution. I have also filed a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and will continually research other options for a timely resolution to this matter. I can be reached at XXXX to further discuss this matter. \\nI posted this response to XXXX  on US Banks page and sent a XXXX  message, they responded that someone would call within one business day. \\nXXXX/Branch Mgr./XXXX  called and apologized, said there was miscommunication between XXXX and us and asked if there was anything else she could do. \\nFiled report with Federal Trade Commission and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. \\nThe District Manager did not call as promised.</td>\n",

            "Complaint:b'I had three credit cards with Barclays. An UBER card, an XXXX XXXX card, and an XXXX  card. The UBER card is the only one I had been using and it was the main credit card I used on a daily basis. In late XX/XX/XXXX, I got a letter from Barclays saying they had closed my XXXX XXXX card due to inactivity. So I went online to see what was going on and found out they had already also closed my XXXX card. Now this was a big deal to me because the XXXX card had rewards on it worth over {$1000.00}. So I called Barclays customer support the next day and ended up having to talk to a manager. The only thing the manager told me was Barclays could close my credit card without notice for any reason. And as much as I tried to get her to comment on the rewards I had, she would not comment on them. Then I notice in Barclays terms and conditions for the XXXX  card that they had a mailing address set up for customers who wanted to make a formal complaint. So I wrote a letter and mailed it via USPS certified mail. Ive been waiting for over a month and have not received a response. \\n\\nThe letter I sent Barclays is attached. It includes more detail such as the fact that I was checking the Barclays web site every month using Barclays mobile app for the XXXX. And even after Barclays closes your credit card, there is no notice in the app that the card has been closed. The card account just shows up completely like a normal account. So there was no way for me to realize the card had been closed. Ive got screen shots of Barclays XXXX app included in the letter that shows this. And there is an XXXX  card account statement included with the letter showing the amount of rewards I had in that account. \\n\\nThe USPS tracking number for the letter I sent Barclays is XXXX.

There was no contact with me to try and work something out. I was notified of this garnishment by my HR on XX/XX/XXXX by email. \\nIssue two I already have a trumping 25 % deduction come from my gross income.

I took possession of the vehicle in early XXXX payment arrangements were settled at around 220 every two weeks. ( Which equaled up to 440 monthly. ) May have been late and also one recovery of the vechile in XXXX. That I will not denie however they didnt repo the car untill summer of XXXX. Moral being from looking at their outstanding balance which reflects ofer XXXX. Which I honestly do not agree with due to having made pmts for 2 years. Then once they did repossess the vechile I continued contact, at which time I was informed XX/XX/XXXX the vechile was being sent to auction. I was informed and insured they would contact me with action price and balance left on account. At which time I was also informed that from that there would most likely be a XXXX balace due to not oweing much more towards the loan. I accepted the information and waited for futher contact on this information. Unfortunately it never came and was unable to connect with them due to time issues. ( My work start/end and their hours. So contact was never connected. ) I was continuously dircted to a voicemail. When I requested to speak with someone that was available I was left with zero information as an ending result. This was due to represnitve not having knowledge of my account. So I was left with no alternative to finding out any information. After about my XXXX call I was informed that the representative that was in charge of my loan information/ payments ect. wasnt going to be in the office for about two weeks due to prescheduled vaction time. Was informed apon her return she would contact me. It was at this point i decided to wait for her to reach out. It was at this point all contact was lost and never regained due to not fault of my own. \\nYears later I only recive court documents that were not even sent to me personally but left to the hr department at my job to provide them. Then looking over the estmated pay off date of XX/XX/XXXX is impossible to reached. At this time I feel as though this was done without my knowledge or consent. Which takes from my income I use to provide with. Futher more punished for their lack of communication. For I made many attempts to reach out with no answer or resolution. Nor the exsact information regarding the auction price/full amount of payments deduction/ and final ptice owed. \\nNow I am back at square 1 with the lack of communication and garnishments equaling out to 50 % deduction as well as medical and taxes.

            "b'The Credit Acceptance Company was granted the right to garnish my wages beginning XX/XX/XXXX. Issue one is that i had no prior knowledge of this. There was no contact with me to try and work something out. I was notified of this garnishment by my HR on XX/XX/XXXX by email. \\nIssue two I already have a trumping 25 % deduction come from my gross income. Needing what I make to care for not only myself but also my XXXX  nephews and my XXXX. Who was recently injured and unable to fulfill his job requirements. That Monday XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX to beg for them to stop the garnishment. Would receive voicemail leave a detailed message. As of XX/XX/XXXX I am still waiting for a response with no relief on my pay I will receive XX/XX/XXXX. Leaving me in a position where I must have been forced to look for another job to help ensure the care of my family is met. \\nIssue 3 when I agreed to obtain this vechile the loan I amount agreed to was around the XXXX dollar mark. I took possession of the vehicle in early XXXX payment arrangements were settled at around 220 every two weeks. ( Which equaled up to 440 monthly. ) May have been late and also one recovery of the vechile in XXXX. That I will not denie however they didnt repo the car untill summer of XXXX. Moral being from looking at their outstanding balance which reflects ofer XXXX. Which I honestly do not agree with due to having made pmts for 2 years. Then once they did repossess the vechile I continued contact, at which time I was informed XX/XX/XXXX the vechile was being sent to auction. I was informed and insured they would contact me with action price and balance left on account. At which time I was also informed that from that there would most likely be a XXXX balace due to not oweing much more towards the loan. I accepted the information and waited for futher contact on this information. Unfortunately it never came and was unable to connect with them due to time issues. ( My work start/end and their hours. So contact was never connected. ) I was continuously dircted to a voicemail. When I requested to speak with someone that was available I was left with zero information as an ending result. This was due to represnitve not having knowledge of my account. So I was left with no alternative to finding out any information. After about my XXXX call I was informed that the representative that was in charge of my loan information/ payments ect. wasnt going to be in the office for about two weeks due to prescheduled vaction time. Was informed apon her return she would contact me. It was at this point i decided to wait for her to reach out. It was at this point all contact was lost and never regained due to not fault of my own. \\nYears later I only recive court documents that were not even sent to me personally but left to the hr department at my job to provide them. Then looking over the estmated pay off date of XX/XX/XXXX is impossible to reached. At this time I feel as though this was done without my knowledge or consent. Which takes from my income I use to provide with. Futher more punished for their lack of communication. For I made many attempts to reach out with no answer or resolution. Nor the exsact information regarding the auction price/full amount of payments deduction/ and final ptice owed. \\nNow I am back at square 1 with the lack of communication and garnishments equaling out to 50 % deduction as well as medical and taxes. Placing great strains on ensuring the basic needs of my family are met.'\n",

The UBER card is the only one I had been using and it was the main credit card I used on a daily basis. In late XX/XX/XXXX, I got a letter from Barclays saying they had closed my XXXX XXXX card due to inactivity. So I went online to see what was going on and found out they had already also closed my XXXX card. Now this was a big deal to me because the XXXX card had rewards on it worth over {$1000.00}. So I called Barclays customer support the next day and ended up having to talk to a manager. The only thing the manager told me was Barclays could close my credit card without notice for any reason. And as much as I tried to get her to comment on the rewards I had, she would not comment on them. Then I notice in Barclays terms and conditions for the XXXX  card that they had a mailing address set up for customers who wanted to make a formal complaint. So I wrote a letter and mailed it via USPS certified mail. Ive been waiting for over a month and have not received a response. \\n\\nThe letter I sent Barclays is attached. It includes more detail such as the fact that I was checking the Barclays web site every month using Barclays mobile app for the XXXX. And even after Barclays closes your credit card, there is no notice in the app that the card has been closed. The card account just shows up completely like a normal account. So there was no way for me to realize the card had been closed. Ive got screen shots of Barclays XXXX app included in the letter that shows this. And there is an XXXX  card account statement included with the letter showing the amount of rewards I had in that account. \\n\\nThe USPS tracking number for the letter I sent Barclays is XXXX.
